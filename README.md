# my 3D Printer Real-Time Dashboard

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.x, Flask, Flask-CORS (`pip install flask flask-cors`).
2. **Save Files**: Place `app.py` and `index.html` in the same directory.
3. **Run**: `python app.py`
4. **Visit**: `http://localhost:5000`
5. **Interact**: Use navbar links, start/Stop/Reset buttons, and view dynamic profile data.

## Assumptions/Design Decisions
- Flask serves UI and API.
- Enhanced navbar with animations and functional links.
- Dynamic user profile with random data.
- Chart.js for temperature graphs.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- **Navbar**: Made it interactive with hover effects and actions.
- **Dynamic Data**: Randomized user details for realism.
- **port issues**: I have faced a Lot of Port Issues because my system is already using those ports so you check once
